# rtf-grimoire
rtf-grimoire is a Rich Text Format (RTF) document tokenizer, intended to enable
the creation of full RTF parsers.

It was written based on the RTF Specification, which unfortunately comes under
an unfriendly license that doesn't allow redistribution, but may be freely
downloaded from Microsoft.

An example parser based on rtf-grimoire may be found on [my github]
(https://github.com/compenguy/rtf2text).  It has been tested with a wide range
of rtf files from a variety of text editors with great success so far.
